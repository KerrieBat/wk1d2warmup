## Question One
You stand at a fork in the road. Next to each of the two forks, there stands a guard. You know the following things: First that one path leads to paradise, the other leads to Death. You cannot distinguish between the two paths. You also know that one of the two guards always tells the truth and the other always lies. You have permission to ask one guard one question to discover which path leads to paradise. What one question would you ask to guarantee you take the path to paradise?

>*If I ask you both which path to take and I want to get to Paradise, what would the other guard tell me?*

## Question Two
A man walks into an art gallery and concentrates on one picture in particular. The museum curator notices this and asks the man why he is so interested in that one painting. The man replies, "Brothers and sisters have I none, but that man's father is my father's son."

Who is in the painting?  
>*My Brother or me if I was a man!*

## Question Four
A man has to get a fox, a chicken, and a sack of corn across a river. He has a row boat, and it can only carry him and one other thing. If the fox and the chicken are left together, the fox will eat the chicken. If the chicken and the corn are left together, the chicken will eat the corn. How does the man do it?

>*Well, the man and the chicken cross the river, ![](#su-amechicken)(the fox and corn are safe together), he leaves the chicken on the other side and goes back across.

>The man then takes the fox across the river, and since he can't leave the fox and chicken together, he brings the chicken back.![](#su-amechicken -r)

>Again, since the chicken and corn can't be left together, he leaves the chicken and he takes the corn across and leaves it with the fox.

>He then returns to pick up the chicken and heads across the river one last time.*

:chicken: :wolf: :corn:
